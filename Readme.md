# CaliPytion - tool for concentration calculation 



## üõ§ What is CaliPytion?

CaliPytion is a tool for concentration calculation based on an analytical standard (standard curve). Thereby, linear and non-linear calibration equations are fitted to the provided standard data. Then, the best model to represent the relationship between analytical signal and concentration is cosen based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC).  
After finding the right model, concentrations of unknown samples can be determined.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick Start

Get started with CaliPytion by cloning this repository:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/FAIRChemistry/CaliPytion/

```

Or install from PyPi:
```Bash
pip install calipytion
```


## üîñ Example Code
